## CNAB

### Introduction

Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB) are a package format specification that describes a technology for bundling, installing, and managing distributed applications, that are by design, cloud agnostic.

The [CNAB](https://cnab.io/) is a name of a package format and also a name for an actual package (bundle).

There are multiple CNAB clients out there, e.g.: [duffle](https://duffle.sh/), [porter](https://porter.sh/) or [docker app](https://github.com/docker/app)

### First steps

- Get the duffle sources with `git clone https://github.com/deislabs/duffle.git` from [github](https://github.com/deislabs/duffle)
- To install it for your system you can also checkout the latest [releases](https://github.com/deislabs/duffle/releases)
- Install and uninstall the helloworld example as described on github
